This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and clustering algorithms to identify similarities among movie plot summaries. The first step involves collecting a dataset of movie plot summaries, either from existing sources or from platforms IMDb or Wikipedia. Subsequently, the collected text data undergoes preprocessing. Feature extraction techniques are then employed to convert the textual content into numerical vectors. Common methods include tokenization, stemming, create TfidfVectorizer enabling the representation of the plot summaries in a format suitable for clustering analysis. The core of the project revolves around clustering algorithm K-Means clustering. These algorithms group together movies with similar plot structures, allowing for the identification of thematic and narrative similarities. The outcome of this project provides a valuable tool for movie enthusiasts, filmmakers, and researchers by offering a systematic approach to explore and understand connections between movies based on their plot summaries.
